# git-formation

Here is a list of all branches and their exercise themes:

exo/oops-i-fucked-up => Learn how to undo your mistakes after manipulating your git history

exo/rebase-basic => [Optional] Basic rebase exercise. Do this if you've never done a rebase before.

exo/rebase-interactive-fixup => Rebase interactive, learn how to use the fixup / squash commands

exo/rebase-interactive-fixup => Rebase interactive, learn how to use --keep-base and the reword command

exo/rebase-onto => Learn how to rebase on a different branch than the original base, using the --onto option

exo/rebase-fork-point => [Optional] Learn how to fix a branch that is rebased off a commit that has since been dropped or squashed from the original base, using the --fork-point option

To do an exercise, simply git switch to that branch and read the README.md

Please only read this file in in the latest version available, I might have changed my mind 3 billion times about which exercises there are or the name of the branches or whatever between now and in 30 minutes
