# git-formation

Here is a list of all branches and their exercise themes:

`exo/oops-i-fucked-up` => Learn how to undo your mistakes after manipulating your git history.

`exo/rebase-basic` => \[Optional\] Basic rebase exercise. Do this if you've never done a rebase before, or to refresh your memory.

`exo/rebase-interactive-fixup` => Rebase interactive, learn how to use the fixup / squash commands.

`exo/rebase-interactive-squash` => More practice with rebase interactive, learn how to use `--keep-base` and the reword command.

`exo/rebase-interactive-editing` => Still more rebase interactive, learn how to use the edit command.

`exo/rebase-onto` => Learn how to rebase on a different branch than the original base, using the `--onto` option.

`exo/rebase-fork-point` => \[Optional\] Learn how to fix a branch that is rebased off a commit that has since been dropped or squashed from the original base, using the `--fork-point` option.

To do an exercise, simply `git switch` to that branch and read the EXERCICE.md file.
